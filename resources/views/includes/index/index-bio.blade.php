        <p class="about-me">I am currently Co-Founder of ROBOAMP, and prior to my deep dive in development, I spent close to 9 years in the Supply Chain and Logistics industry, but my passion for emerging and forever evolving technology fueled my career path transition.</p>
        <p class="about-me">Some of the most valuable lessons I learned during my professional career was the importance of continous improvement and being about to adapt to change. I believe you must always be improving, whether it be yourself, your work, the process, the people around you, the list goes on. I also believe that you must be willing and open to change. Change will never stop. The more willing you are to adapt, the more successful you will be.</p>
